# React + Webpack

Hi!

Please, [clone me](https://github.com/OlegMikhailov23/react-webpack) https://github.com/OlegMikhailov23/react-webpack

### Installation
```sh
$ npm i
```

### To run dev server
```sh
$ npm run dev
```

### To build 'dist/'
```sh
$ npm run build
```
You don't need switch dev. or prod. in config:)

Good luck!
